# SQL-Direct
## **The Goal**: Find the flag in a PostgreSQL database.

## 1. **Connect to the Server**

Look at challenge description on picoCTF, it will give you a command.
It usually looks like this:

```
 bash 
 psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 1234 -U postgres pico 
```
* -h: The host (server address).
* -p: The port (this changes every time you start the instance).
* -U: The username (postgres).
* pico: The name of the database.
* Password: When prompted, type postgres (the text won't show as you type).

_We have direct access but don't know the table names_
## 2. **Find the Tables**
Once you see **pico=#**, you are inside the database. You need to see what **"folders" (tables)** exist. 

Type the command:
```
\l
```

## 3. **Get the Flag**

you can use a standard SQL query to read everything inside that table:
``` 
SELECT * FROM flags;
``` 
or 
```
/dt
```
\dt stands for **"Display Tables"**

```
TABLE flags;
```

And the flag was:picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_21c94904}
